To remove, add, or reorder images, go to setup.js and add, remove, or
reorder elements in the 'art', 'photos', 'design', or 'illustration' arrays,
each one corresponding to one of the pages.

Anytime you change the javascript, you'll need to reminify it. To do this,
run the command

./minifyjs.sh

in the terminal. If that doesn't work, try opening minifyjs.sh and removing
the pound sign from the third and fourth line, and running it again (put the
# signs back after you run it this first time). If that still doesn't work,
you can either include the javascript unminified in your site, or find
another way to minify the javascript, there are lots of them.

To include the javascript unminified just remove the script tag for
my.min.js in index.html and in it's place put a script tag for each js file, 
in the order listed in minifyjs.sh.


To change the text on the front page, simply put whatever you like in the 
"fronttext" div in index.html.

The contact info in the footer can be changed by putting new content in the
"info" divs within the "footercontent" div, itself within the "footer" div.

I wouldn't mess with the "frame", "bwork", or "imagedecoration" divs, since
the javascript messes with them alot.
